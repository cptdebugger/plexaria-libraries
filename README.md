# plexaria-libraries

This repository hosts Maven artifacts used by PlexariaAuth for on-demand library downloads.
I could download these dependencies directly from their original sources, but under unclear circumstances the plugin does not behave correctly, so I maintain a mirror here and update it as a temporary solution.

Maven repository (GitHub Pages):
https://cptdebugger.github.io/plexaria-libraries/maven/

Releases contain the same artifacts as a mirror.
