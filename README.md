# plexaria-libraries

This repository hosts library releases used by PlexariaAuth for on-demand downloads.
I could use direct downloads for automatic library updates, but unfortunately under unclear circumstances the plugin does not behave correctly, so I have to maintain this repository and update the libraries here. (Hopefully this is a temporary solution.)

Releases contain the same artifacts as a mirror.
